Create a calculator program and that can perform basic mathematic tasks, composed of the following operations:

•   addition

•   subtraction

Candidates should develop a user interface for this program (either storyboards or in code) that runs this program in portrait and landscape orientations on iPad and iPhone. At minimum, the user interface should include numbers 0-9, a display for the user entry/calculated output, and operands as described above (+, -, *, /).
